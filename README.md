Welcome to the onboarding project for AWH!

This repo contains one solution with two projects.  It is targeted for C# and Javascript deveopers.  
####Project Clockwork.API####
Clockwork.API is a simple api that returns a time date object and records the IP address, and timeate of any callers to the API in a SQLite database.

####Project Clockwork.Web####
Clockwork.Web is a simple website that uses javascript to call the API at the push of a button and displays the result JSON object.

####Required Technologies####
* A windows or Mac computer
* Visual Studio Community Edition (latest version).  Note there are missing components on MAC that you will have to self install (nuget CLI) to run the API project while running the website.

### What is this repository for? ###
The goal of this exercise is to get this solution up and running as part of the onboarding to AWH.  This is to test your ability to work with git, compile existing applications and to fix issues that you encounter with getting a project up and running.

Once you have a running project that works as intended, you will be asked to make several feature enhancements.

* Clockwork version 1.0

### How do I get set up? ###

* Install visual studio if you do not have it set up
* clone this repo

* Check CORS access
* Since this is a code first project you may need to run migrations to generate the database.
